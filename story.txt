There was this man that was super effcient and clean.

To be honest, I have no idea how he does it. lol

One day, he heard that in the distant western country, a gentle and lovely dragon was imprisoned by the evil princess.

This man was the best of the best when it came to freeing dragons from evil princesses. He had the perfect plan. He would travel to 
this distant country, and then fight the princess, and ride away on the dragon and start a new life with the dragon as protection, 
in a cave up in the hills. Of course he wouldnt forget to bring hand sanatizer and deodorant, to stay clean. 

Since the man was so clean, he had to shower the lovely dragon everyday, but he was too tired to do so, so he hired a maid for make 
the dragon and his home clean and tidy. However, the maid was disguised by the evil princess, and the princess was looking for a chance 
to kill the man and take the dragon back. The clever dragon recognized the princess, and it told the man, the man thus fight the princess
again and killed her.

So the man lived forever ever after just like some fairy tale.
