There was this man that was super effcient and clean.

To be honest, I have no idea how he does it. lol

One day, he heard that in the distant western country, a gentle and lovely dragon was imprisoned by the evil princess.

This man was the best of the best when it came to freeing dragons from evil princesses. He had the perfect plan. He would travel to 
this distant country, and then fight the princess, and ride away on the dragon and start a new life with the dragon as protection, 
in a cave up in the hills. Of course he wouldnt forget to bring hand sanatizer and deodorant, to stay clean.
